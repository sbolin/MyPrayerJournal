#  MyPrayerJournal

## Things to do:
- Reordering and Sorting
- Expand on widgets - larger sizes show more requests
- Refactor CoreDataController

## One day things to do:
- Verses functionality - Just plain text, add lookup?
- Use @SectionedFetchRequest???


##Previously Completed
~~- Screen grabs of app, then use Forge to create marking pics.~~
~~- Daily notification of focus item~~
~~- Tags are ok, but deleting them is odd - menu shows up outside of tag, not attached to tag. Just add a "x" and not use the menu~~
~~- Tags functionality - show up initially, but don't save~~
~~- Topic is missing!~~
~~- Widget!~~
~~- Get rid of views that aren't needed: RequestDetailView, FocusPrayerView~~
~~- Get basic functionality working (CRUD Requests)~~
~~- PrayerJournalView doesn't update properly after changes made~~
~~- Change completed button to toggle (minor change)~~
~~- SectionedFetchRequest? Or calculated sections?~~
