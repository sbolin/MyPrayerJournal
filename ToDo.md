#  MyPrayerJournal

## Things to do:
- Refactor CoreDataController
- Get rid of views that aren't needed: RequestDetailView, FocusPrayerView
~~- Get basic functionality working (CRUD Requests)~~
~~- PrayerJournalView doesn't update properly after changes made~~
~~- Change completed button to toggle (minor change)~~
~~- SectionedFetchRequest? Or calculated sections?~~
- Tags functionality
- Verses functionality
