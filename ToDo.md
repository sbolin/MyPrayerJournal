#  MyPrayerJournal

## Things to do:
- Tags are ok, but deleting them is odd - menu shows up outside of tag, not attached to tag.
- Refactor CoreDataController
- Sorting (sort of works?)
- Reordering (need to work with Sorting)
- Expand on widgets - larger sizes show more requests

## One day things to do:
- Verses functionality - Just plain text, add lookup?
- More search options (currently searches request, topic, and tags - add lesson and verse?)

~~- Tags functionality - show up initially, but don't save~~
~~- Topic is missing!~~
~~- Widget!~~
~~- Get rid of views that aren't needed: RequestDetailView, FocusPrayerView~~
~~- Get basic functionality working (CRUD Requests)~~
~~- PrayerJournalView doesn't update properly after changes made~~
~~- Change completed button to toggle (minor change)~~
~~- SectionedFetchRequest? Or calculated sections?~~
